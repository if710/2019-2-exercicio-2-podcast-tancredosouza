                In this episode I talk about what I feel to be requirements in developing mobile applications. I've broken these requirements into three main categories, being, the planning requirement, the execution requirement, and the post release marketing requirement. Have you ever wondered the fees for releasing your application to the various app stores or what kind of development hardware you need? Get all the information you need to get your app development business kick started. A writeup to this episode can be found via https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/01/tpdp-episode-1-requirements-developing-mobile-applications/ on my blog.

                In this episode I talk about my experience as a mobile developer and some of the native and hybrid apps that I've published to the various app stores like, but not limited to, Google Play and iTunes. As a developer that has used both native and hybrid for development, I discuss where I feel native mobile app development succeeds and also where it falls short, making room for hybrid technologies like Apache Cordova, Xamarin, and Telerik NativeScript.

                In this episode I'm joined by two of my good friends Simon Reimler and Ray Camden where we discuss some of the software, tools and services available that can boost development and marketing productivity of your next big application. I've broken this episode into three main categories, being, tools used for planning before development or design, tools used for development and designing an application up to its release, and tools for maintaining and driving the success of an application after its been released. You'll get to know what we're using and how it might help you out in any of your development adventures.

                In this episode I'm joined by a former colleague, and friend, William Hoang where we discuss a lot of jargon that comes up with modern software development. I've broken this episode into a few parts. We're going to discuss mobile first development, API first development, and offline first development and how you should choose between them when planning or developing an application.

                In this episode I'm joined by TJ VanToll, Developer Advocate at Telerik, where we discuss the cross platform mobile development framework NativeScript. We cover everything from what is NativeScript, what do you need to start developing NativeScript applications, and how it differs or why you should use it versus native development or development with a different hybrid mobile framework. TJ talks about where things are headed when it comes to mobile development, who is using Telerik NativeScript to develop apps, and how Angular 2 fits into the framework. This is the most exciting episode yet on The Polyglot Developer Podcast and I recommend listening to it if you're interested in mobile application development, whether it be for personal or for your business. A writeup to this episode can be found via https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/05/tpdp-episode-5-developing-mobile-apps-telerik-nativescript/ on my blog.

                In this episode I am joined by Nolan Lawson, one of the main contributors on the PouchDB open source project. We discuss everything from what is PouchDB, what does it do under the covers, what development platforms are supported, and what does it aim to accomplish that might have been particularly difficult with another tool. This episode is targeted towards web and mobile developers who include JavaScript as one of the core technologies in their stack because PouchDB is in fact a JavaScript wrapper. I've personally used PouchDB in the past because it makes it incredibly easy to synchronize data with remote databases via a web or mobile application. If you're investigating sync solutions, Nolan and I have you covered in this episode. A writeup to this episode can be found via https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2016/06/tpdp-episode-6-pouchdb-usefulness-browser-based-development/ If you have questions that you'd like answered in the next episode, visit https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/podcast-questions and fill out the form.

                In this episode I am joined by Matt Holt, creator of the very popular web server known as Caddy. Instead of focusing on Caddy in this particular episode, we focus on the Go programming language, which was used to make Caddy so successful. The Go programming language, sometimes referred to as Golang, is a very popular alternative to languages like PHP and Node.js because it is very fast, efficient, and lightweight in comparison. Both Matt and I explore why this is and how you can use it in your own applications.

                In this episode I am joined by Krishna Srinivas, engineer at the open source object storage company, Minio. Krishna and I discuss object storage which is different than database storage or plain filesystem storage. A popular object solution is Amazon S3, but it is not the only solution. Object storage is great for protecting data from corruption or loss as well as providing a great way to work with it via standard HTTP. This makes it great for application development.

                In this episode I am joined by Krishna Srinivas, engineer at the open source object storage company, Minio. Krishna and I discuss object storage which is different than database storage or plain filesystem storage. A popular object solution is Amazon S3, but it is not the only solution. Object storage is great for protecting data from corruption or loss as well as providing a great way to work with it via standard HTTP. This makes it great for application development.

                In this episode I am joined by Ryan Chenkie, Developer Advocate at the internet safety company, Auth0. Ryan and I discuss OAuth and how it can be used for authorizing third-party access to your data. If you've been keeping up, you'll remember that I wrote the very popular ng-cordova-oauth and ng2-cordova-oauth libraries for Ionic Framework that allowed mobile applications to work with OAuth providers like Google and Facebook. There are a lot of common questions around the protocol such as storing tokens, refreshing tokens, and implementing OAuth logic within code. The goal in this episode is to clear up the common questions and give everyone a better understanding on how OAuth works as well as the best practicies.

                In this episode I am joined by Brenda itReverie, a fellow application developer that I met when I was at NativeScript Developer Days 2017. Brenda and I shift the focus away from software development for a moment and focus on hunting down and locking in a job in application development, a subject that is long, stressful, and never pleasant. In this episode we answer all your questions regarding getting called by recruiters and tackling those complicated algorithm and coding challenges given in the various interviews. The goal of this episode is to give you some pointers towards being successful and giving you something to anticipate to make the process a little less stressful.

                In this episode I'm joined by Carlos Santana who works on the Cloud Functions team at IBM. Carlos and I get all your questions answered when it comes to what serverless is and how you can create your own very scalable functions that can be deployed on it. We name drop a few providers such as AWS Lambda and Azure Functions, but the focus is centered around IBM's Cloud Functions service which uses Apache OpenWhisk. If you're into developing web applications, learning about functions as a service (FaaS) is for you.

                In this episode I'm joined by Jim Clark who works as the Chief Architect at Atomist. Jim and I spend a lot of time discussing how the pipeline model to software delivery can be improved by making it a workflow and event driven model instead with a service like Atomist. The pipeline approach can only get you so far and it is limited in how the appropriate teams can get the necessary notifications to function efficiently. Jim and I explore how to get beyond these common problems.

Coming from RESTful API development, I've run into many pain-points that GraphQL works to alleviate, and is one of the reasons why I've become such an advocate for it for modern development. Lee and I spend a lot of time discussing the fundamentals of GraphQL and how to get started with it in development. Not only are we focusing on the how, but we are also focusing on the why, which is very important when evaluating a new technology and methodology.

                In this episode I'm joined by Matt Groves, Senior Developer Advocate at the NoSQL database company, Couchbase. The focus of this episode is to become familiar with NoSQL and where it makes sense to use it in your projects, both new and old. Matt and explore numerous NoSQL database technologies which include Graph, Document, Key-Value, and Columnar, and look at the possible advantages they bring over the RDBMS alternative.

The focus of this episode is to become familiar with NoSQL and where it makes sense to use it in your projects, both new and old. Matt and explore numerous NoSQL database technologies which include Graph, Document, Key-Value, and Columnar, and look at the possible advantages they bring over the RDBMS alternative.

                In this episode I'm joined by first time guest, Rob Lauer, and repeat guest TJ VanToll, to talk about securing mobile applications from multiple perspectives. Both Rob and TJ work for Progress, the core contributors of the mobile development framework, NativeScript, but NativeScript is by no means the focus of the episode. The focus is around security, and that can mean numerous things ranging from code security, the security of any data on the device at rest, and the security of data being sent to remote web services. In this episode we break down each of these categories and give potential ideas to get beyond them.

                In this episode I'm joined by Luke Walker who is a Solutions Architect at Yubico, the company that creates security hardware tokens such as the YubiKey. Security is a big deal in for both end users who are supplying data and developers who are working to keep that data safe. Luke and I spend some time in this episode discussing some of the various two-factor authentication (2FA) mechenisms that can be implemented in web applications and where some of these mechenisms fall short. In addition to things like TOTP, SMS, we also dive deep into the FIDO and FIDO2 protocol which Yubico implements and is pushing as a web standard.

                In this episode I'm joined by Ben Mears who works for SideFX, a visual effects company for the gaming and film industry. The focus of this particular episode is around Houdini, a popular tool used within both industries. However, we're going to put a gaming spin on the episode. Creating visual effects for games can be complicated and time consuming, but they don't have to be. With Houdini, you can use procedural, node-based workflows, for generating game assets and terrains. Ben Mears and I explore what exactly this means in this first ever gaming episode of the podcast featuring Houdini.

                In this episode I'm joined by Bjørn Erik Pedersen, the core maintainer of Hugo, a popular static site generator built with the Go programming language. Content management systems can be clunky because of all the layers involved in the stack. These systems usually have a database and backend technology in place before the content is ever sent to the browser for rendering. Not to mention, the more layers you are working with, the higher chance you'll be attacked through a bug or exploit. This is where static site generation comes into play. Instead of working with a database and backend technology, all content is exported to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The content can be written in numerous formats, one of which is Markdown. Static site generation is made possible through themes and templates, all of which you'll learn about in this episode with Bjørn Erik.

                In this episode I'm joined by Ben Nelson, co-founder of Lambda School, an increasingly popular coding bootcamp with a slightly different structure and monetization strategy than the others. Computer Science programs at a university are known to be tough, painful, and exhausting. This is because of the nature of the material, duration of the program, and the fact that you're probably going to be challenged with difficult classes outside the direct scope of software development. This is where coding schools such as Lambda School come into play because these are programs that are designed to teach you relevant workforce skills in short amounts of time. Ben Nelson experienced a traditional university, switched to a popular coding bootcamp, and then started his own coding bootcamp because of the experience it was giving students. I personally only ever completed a Computer Science program at a university, so this episode shares perspectives and information from both points of view.

                In this episode I'm joined by Corbin Crutchley, a seasoned JavaScript developer with extensive knowledge of various frameworks such as Vue.js, Angular, and React.js. Corbin also operates his own development blog, Unicorn Utterances. The topic of this episode is around asynchronous development using JavaScript and no particular framework. If you're coming from other programming languages, the concept of promises, callbacks, async / await, and similar all might seem daunting when it comes to working with remote web services or even resource intensive proccesses. Corbin and I shed some light into the world of doing things asynchronously and hopefully clear things up and even make the concepts easier to wrap your head around.

                In this episode I'm joined by Vijay Menon, organizer of the JavaScriptLA and JavaScript South Bay Meetup groups in Southern California. The topic of this episode is around the importance of being a part of a developer community and building your own if one doesn't already exist in your local area. In this episode you'll hear success stories that Vijay has had at his very large and successful developer communities and the work that is involved for building and managing your own on Meetup.com.

                In this episode I'm joined by Adrienne Tacke, author of Coding for Kids: Python, and Alex Ziskind, owner of the NativeScripting course platform. The topic of this episode is broken into two parts. The first is around improving your skills as a developer through different education avenues such as eBooks, video courses, conferences, and other events. The three of us on the show are developers, like many of the listeners. We each have our own methods towards learning new development technologies or deepening our skills with the technologies we're already using. Some of these methods might not be obvious and it's something we want to share. The second part of the episode is around taking the developer skills that you have and then using them to teach others through writing your own eBooks or courses, and what it looks like in terms of hardware, funding, and similar.
